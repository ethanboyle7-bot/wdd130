        <p>Hello! My name is Ethan Boyle and I am from Sydney, Australia. I enjoy Video Games and Art.
            I am enrolled in BYU-Pathways to learn about software development in the hopes of creating programs and
            video games of my own some day. I am looking forward to learning more about Web Development and working with
            likeminded individuals in this course!
